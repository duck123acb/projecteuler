# main???????

The main script helps streamline the Project Euler workflow by generating a Python boilerplate file for any given problem number. It places the file in the problems/ directory and includes a basic template with a link to the problem and a structure to get started.

Basically it:
1. Asks for a Project Euler problem number
2. Creates a file named problems/[number].py

3. Fills it with:
- A comment linking to the problem
- A main() function stub
- A call to a check() function for verifying the answer
